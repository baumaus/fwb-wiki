# ðŸ’« Hackathons

FWB and [Zora](https://zora.co) hosted FWB's first ever hackathon on Sunday, August 29, 2021. Since the start of FWB, the amount of great ideas outweighed the chance to contribute to the product. This inaugural hackathon was a way to start changing that.

FWB Hackathons allow you to roll up your sleeves and build, to collaborate with other product passionate FWBs, exercise your creative vision, form friendships and relationships, and create an opportunity for everyone to get involved with FWB product output.

### How did it work?

* The hackathon was announced on the #announcements channel in discord.
* A site was set up with a sign-up form where participants entered relevant info about what skills and expertise they could bring to a Hackathon team.
* After completing the sign up form, participants were dropped automatically into the FWBxZORA Hackathon lobby channel in discord. There they could view other hacker's submissions, mingle, and reach out to other individuals to form teams.
* Participants were given 3 days to form teams and register as such at a provided link. You could only be a member of 1 team.
* Day of the hackathon a meeting was scheduled for opening remarks and to get acquainted with tools and deliverables. Teams were given from 2p - 8p to hack to their hearts content and get submissions in by close time.
* A set of judges decided on the 3 most exciting projects and those teams were selected to move onto the next phase of the Hackathon.
* Those 3 teams were given 2 weeks to build their proposed project with the support from FWB.
* At the end of the 2 weeks, teams presented their projects to the broader FWB community in a town hall and the community voted on a 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place.

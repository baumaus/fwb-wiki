# üåü Proposals

### üí° **What Is a Proposal?**

At FWB, members can create a proposal for a project that they think would benefit the FWB community.

One way to think of a proposal is a trade offer: "Proposal: FWB commits _\<X>_, and in return we receive _\<Y>_". Members can help shape the future of FWB by participating in governance and by creating proposals.

At the time of this writing, proposals is usually done in an ad hoc manner, although there is a formalized proposals process set to be released in the near future by the Memberships Team.

Proposals typically start with a conversation in any FWB Discord channel. From there, the next step is for one or more members create a Google doc outlining the project, its impact, and the project's request for funding.

Once the proposal doc is created, a thread is created in the [#live-proposals](https://discord.com/channels/749418486874243212/912826702311329812/913552142319632384) channel, and the proposal is discussed and workshopped.

[Here's one example](https://discord.com/channels/749418486874243212/871132840744607745/912826702311329812)

Proposals are typically green-lit and receive funding at the beginning of a Season, but are occasionally green-lit mid-Season if the need is urgent.

### üåü **What Can You Propose?**

Community-led initiatives that require support from the DAO start life as a proposal. If you have an idea for an opportunity to improve FWB or a solution to a problem you see in FWB, a proposal is a good way to make it happen.

There are two categories for proposals: **Departmental** and **DAO.**

Proposals fall under the departmental category if they can be implemented and housed under existing FWB teams and work streams. The DAO category refers to proposals that affect the entire organization and involve larger community buy-in.

Here are some examples of what FWB members can propose:

* Product initiatives
* Sub-DAOs
* DAO-wide marketing or brand campaigns
* IRL events
* Digital events
* Channels
* Treasury investing strategies
* Forming new teams that sit alongside Editorial, Product, etc.

### üê£ FWB Proposal Committee

The FWB Proposal Committee helps set up the structure for how the community creates and interacts with proposals.

Since FWB is a DAO, the committee's goal is to be hands-on for one or two Seasons until the proposal process is established in the community. The committee will help prepare proposals for a vote and push them to the right groups (sub-DAOs, partnerships, full community snapshot). They do not decide what is approved.

### ‚úçÔ∏è FWB Proposal Process

1. Once you have a concrete idea, prepare an abridged proposal in a Google doc. Describe what you are proposing and why, along with other relevant details.
2. Review the [FWB Proposal Guidelines](https://www.notion.so/Proposals-0e23e5bea312403890bbca7c23109f91#624bb0ae3bff41baab9a491cf61a2e3f).
3. Test broader community interest by talking to other community members. Assess if this is also a problem other people are experiencing or if it is an improvement that members can benefit from.
4. Ping the ‚ö™**`Proposal Review Committee`** role in the `#üèõÔ∏ègovernance` channel for support to help you refine the proposal and get it ready for a community vote.
5. Share the proposal with the FWB community.
6. Vote on Snapshot.

### ‚ö° Voting On Proposals as an FWB Member

FWB members vote on proposals to approve them in the DAO. To do this [we use Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth), which is a Web3 voting tool, that uses an off-chain signing mechanic. This allows people to create and vote on proposals without having to pay gas fees.

[See previous FWB proposals here.](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth)

To use Snapshot, connect your wallet which holds 75 $FWB and vote on an open proposal on the site. Proposals are only open for a certain period of time. Some proposals come with a POAP that you can claim after casting your vote.

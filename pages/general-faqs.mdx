## About FWB

### What is FWB?

Friends with Benefits is the ultimate cultural membership powered by a community of our favorite Web3 artists, operators, and thinkers bound together by shared values and shared incentives ($FWB).

To join FWB, you must hold $FWB cryptocurrency tokens. This means that everyone in the community is literally invested in the community‚Äôs success and gets to participate in the upside of the value we create together.

### Who is in FWB?

Without naming names, we'll just say that in FWB you'll find creatives, DJs, musicians, programmers, community builders, investors, and others.

### What happens in FWB?

The most prominent streams in FWB are our text channels and our voice chats. In the past, we've had voice chats with people like Nadya from Pussy Riot and Shannon Woodward, Masego, Amon Tobin, and others.

There are numerous voice chats that happen in the Discord every week, including: biweekly FWB Town Halls, Seed Club Token Talk(led by [Jess Sloss](https://twitter.com/thattallguy), of Seed Club and SquiggleDAO), the Metaverse Exploratory Committee, FWB New Member Hang, and others.

### How much $FWB do I need to become a member?

* 75 $FWB tokens for membership
* 5 $FWB for access to Cities channel/tier
* 1 $FWB for access to tl;dr Digest
* 100 $FWB for FWB access with Substack

### Are my $FWB holdings a membership fee?

No. FWB does not collect a fee from you in the same way a private club collects a membership fee. Buying the FWB tokens as a means of access is an investment in the community that you hold and you can sell it at anytime (but you'll lose access if you do).

### Could my $FWB holdings become worth less over time?

Yes. The token price fluctuates as will the value of your $FWB holdings.

### Where do I buy $FWB?

Best place to buy: Uniswap. Alternatively you can use the swap function in MetaMask.

Verify that you're buying the correct token. FWB Pro with Contract ID: [0x35bd01fc9d6d5d81ca9e055db88dc49aa2c699a8](https://etherscan.io/address/0x35bd01fc9d6d5d81ca9e055db88dc49aa2c699a8) is the correct one.

### What if I can't afford the $FWB required for membership?

The token price also fluctuates. If the time is not right financially for you to join, you can always wait for a fluctuation in the token price. We do also offer scholarships (see below).

### Do you offer scholarships?

Yes. FWB offers scholarships based on merit, need, and inclusiveness of under-represented communities. If you feel like you fit the bill please feel free to DM a member of the Host Committee for information on the scholarships program

## Application process

### Where do I find the application form?

The membership application can be found here: [fwb.help/join](http://fwb.help/join)

### Do I need to hold $FWB to start my application?

Nope, you can apply without holding FWB tokens. You will need the minimum amount of tokens required for your membership tier once you've been approved.

### The application form doesn't allow me to submit. What's up?

A common error is not filling out your Discord ID correctly. Please have potential new members copy-paste it from their Discord landing screen. Hover over your ID in the lower-left until the ‚Äòcopy user ID‚Äô prompt appears, and click to copy.

If you did not include your wallet address or you used an invalid Discord ID, you will not see the full application which includes city, interests, and three open response questions.

### How long does it take to get approved as a new member?

Current turnaround time is approximately 2 weeks. If that period includes holidays it may be longer.

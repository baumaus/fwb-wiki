### What Is the FWB Cities Program?

[The FWB Cities program](https://fwb.mirror.xyz/DXauHLSikMA\_lttUkH1tsxiIt8PFwv6gC8oXB5qgA0o) includes three cities in which FWB is building an "IRL layer" and establishing as "home bases" for FWB: London, New York, and Los Angeles. Each of these cities' programming is run by [a City Lead and a Partnerships lead](https://snapshot.org/#/city.fwb.eth), in addition to support from those participating in and attending FWB Cities events. Each city effectively functions as a "sub-DAO" of FWB, and work in coordination with [two FWB Cities treasurers](https://snapshot.org/#/city.fwb.eth).

All FWB Cities channels can be viewed on the FWB Discord server. You are encouraged to pick one that feels most like home, but feel free to participate in any/all three. For instance, many folks dropped into the NYC Cities channel to find cool events and lodging during [NFT.NYC](http://nft.nyc) 2021.

Our official FWB Cities - London, New York, and Los Angeles - have elected their own City Teams and will be hosting experiences ranging from local dinners to partnering with local co-working spaces to pooling capital to invest in local initiatives.

Beginning in Season 4, FWB introduced [**the FWB Local membership tier**](https://fwb.mirror.xyz/DXauHLSikMA\_lttUkH1tsxiIt8PFwv6gC8oXB5qgA0o). This new membership level is much more accessible, at a cost of only having to hold 5 FWB. By holding 5 $FWB, Local Tier members are allowed to participate in FWB Cities conversations, governance, events, and experiences.

### Why Was FWB Cities Created?

FWB Cities was established as part of the evolving organization of FWB. FWB began, and still functions as, a hub-and-spoke network:

With the establishment of sub-DAOs in the form of FWB Cities, FWB is moving towards organizing itself as a multi-hub network with products and initiatives being driven on the local level - see graphic below. Read more about the effort to grow locally in [Season 4's announcement here](https://fwb.mirror.xyz/DXauHLSikMA\_lttUkH1tsxiIt8PFwv6gC8oXB5qgA0o).
